fresh,a fantasy adventure that fuses greek mythology to contemporary american places and values anyone around 15 give or take a couple of years will thrill to the visual spectacle
fresh,uma thurman as medusa the gorgon with a coiffure of writhing snakes and stoneinducing hypnotic gaze is one of the highlights of this bewitching fantasy
fresh,with a topnotch cast and dazzling special effects this will tide the teens over until the next harry potter instalment
fresh,whether audiences will get behind the lightning thief is hard to predict overall its an entertaining introduction to a promising new world but will the consuming shadow of potter be too big to break free of
rotten,whats really lacking in the lightning thief is a genuine sense of wonder the same thing that brings viewers back to hogwarts over and over again
rotten,its more a list of ingredients than a moviemagic potion to enjoy from start to finish
rotten,harry potter knockoffs dont come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabefranchise jumpstarter directed by chris columbus
fresh,percy jackson isnt a great movie but its a good one trotting out kernels of greek mythology like so many disney channel references
fresh,fun brisk and imaginative
fresh,crammed with dragons setdestroying fights and things exploding columbus squeezes in a few wellmeaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display
fresh,this actionpacked fantasy adventure based on rick riordans hit percy jackson and the olympians series of books is great fun and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any harry potter magic
rotten,for what it is and for whom it is intended its not a bad movie just an indifferent one
rotten,chris columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless episodic fantasy saga based on the youngreader book series by rick riordan
fresh,the best thing you can say about chris columbuss adaptation is that hes incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more
rotten,this cast is simply too generic none of the young thespians stick out
fresh,percy jackson may not be harry potter good but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a movie they can bring them to thats familyfriendly
fresh,perfectly inoffensive occasionally clever its in the few genuinely cinematically joyful moments the ones that do rise above the formula that you realize how much more this could have been
rotten,admirably the movie isnt bogged down in the exposition common to first entries but at the end its a franchise searching for its voice
fresh,the main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained british actors
